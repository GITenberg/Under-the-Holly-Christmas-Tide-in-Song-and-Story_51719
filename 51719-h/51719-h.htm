<h2>CHRISTMAS.</h2>



<p>Of all the old festivals, that of Christmas
awakens the strongest and most heartfelt
associations. There is a tone of solemn and
sacred feeling that blends with our conviviality,
and lifts the spirit to a state of hallowed and
elevated enjoyment. The services of the church
about this season are extremely tender and inspiring.
They dwell on the beautiful story of the
origin of our faith, and the pastoral scenes that
accompanied its announcement. They gradually
increase in fervor and pathos during the season
of Advent, until they break forth in full jubilee
on the morning that brought peace and good-will
to men. I do not know a grander effect of
music on the moral feelings than to hear the full
choir and the pealing organ performing a Christmas
anthem in a cathedral, and filling every part
of the vast pile with triumphant harmony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a beautiful arrangement, also, derived
from days of yore, that this festival, which commemorates
the announcement of the religion of
peace and love, has been made the season for
gathering together of family connections, and
drawing closer again those bands of kindred
hearts which the cares and pleasures and sorrows
of the world are continually operating to cast
loose; of calling back the children of a family
who have launched forth in life, and wandered
widely asunder, once more to assemble about
the paternal hearth, that rallying-place of the
affections, there to grow young and loving again
among the endearing mementos of childhood.</p>

<p>There is something in the very season of the
year that gives a charm to the festivity of Christmas.
At other times we derive a great portion of
our pleasures from the mere beauties of Nature.
Our feelings sally forth and dissipate themselves
over the sunny landscape, and we "live abroad
and everywhere." The song of the bird, the
murmur of the stream, the breathing fragrance
of spring, the soft voluptuousness of summer, the
golden pomp of autumn; earth with its mantle
of refreshing green, and heaven with its deep
delicious blue and its cloudy magnificence,&mdash;all
fill us with mute but exquisite delight, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
revel in the luxury of mere sensation. But in
the depth of winter, when Nature lies despoiled
of every charm, and wrapped in her shroud of
sheeted snow, we turn for our gratifications to
moral sources. The dreariness and desolation
of the landscape, the short gloomy days and
darksome nights, while they circumscribe our
wanderings, shut in our feelings also from rambling
abroad, and make us more keenly disposed
for the pleasures of the social circle. Our
thoughts are more concentrated; our friendly
sympathies more aroused. We feel more sensibly
the charm of each other's society, and are
brought more closely together by dependence on
each other for enjoyment. Heart calleth unto
heart; and we draw our pleasures from the
deep wells of living kindness, which lie in the
quiet recesses of our bosoms, and which, when
resorted to, furnish forth the pure element of
domestic felicity.</p>

<p>The pitchy gloom without makes the heart
dilate on entering the room filled with the glow
and warmth of the evening fire. The ruddy
blaze diffuses an artificial summer and sunshine
through the room, and lights up each countenance
into a kindlier welcome. Where does the
honest face of hospitality expand into a broader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and more cordial smile, where is the shy glance
of love more sweetly eloquent, than by the winter
fireside? and as the hollow blast of wintry
wind rushes through the hall, claps the distant
door, whistles about the casement, and rumbles
down the chimney, what can be more grateful
than that feeling of sober and sheltered security
with which we look round upon the comfortable
chamber and the scene of domestic hilarity?</p>

<p>The English, from the great prevalence of
rural habits throughout every class of society,
have always been fond of those festivals and
holidays which agreeably interrupt the stillness
of country life; and they were, in former days,
particularly observant of the religious and social
rites of Christmas. It is inspiring to read even
the dry details which some antiquarians have
given of the quaint humors, the burlesque pageants,
the complete abandonment to mirth and
good-fellowship, with which this festival was celebrated.
It seemed to throw open every door,
and unlock every heart. It brought the peasant
and the peer together, and blended all ranks in
one warm, generous flow of joy and kindness.
The old halls of castles and manor-houses resounded
with the harp and the Christmas carol,
and their ample boards groaned under the weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
of hospitality. Even the poorest cottage welcomed
the festive season with green decorations
of bay and holly; the cheerful fire glanced its
rays through the lattice, inviting the passenger to
raise the latch, and join the gossip knot huddled
round the hearth, beguiling the long evening with
legendary jokes and oft-told Christmas tales.</p>

<p>One of the least pleasing effects of modern
refinement is the havoc it has made among the
hearty old holiday customs. It has completely
taken off the sharp touchings and spirited reliefs
of these embellishments of life, and has worn
down society into a more smooth and polished,
but certainly a less characteristic surface. Many
of the games and ceremonials of Christmas have
entirely disappeared, and like the sherris-sack
of old Falstaff, are become matters of speculation
and dispute among commentators. They
flourished in times full of spirit and lustihood,
when men enjoyed life roughly, but heartily and
vigorously,&mdash;times wild and picturesque, which
have furnished poetry with its richest materials,
and the drama with its most attractive variety of
characters and manners. The world has become
more worldly. There is more of dissipation
and less of enjoyment. Pleasure has expanded
into a broader but a shallower stream, and has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
forsaken many of those deep and quiet channels
where it flowed sweetly through the calm bosom
of domestic life. Society has acquired a more
enlightened and elegant tone; but it has lost
many of its strong local peculiarities, its home-bred
feelings, its honest fireside delights. The
traditionary customs of golden-hearted antiquity,
its feudal hospitalities and lordly wassailings, have
passed away with the baronial castles and stately
manor-houses in which they were celebrated.
They comported with the shadowy hall, the great
oaken gallery, and the tapestried parlor, but are
unfitted to the light showy saloons and gay
drawing-rooms of the modern villa.</p>

<p>Shorn, however, as it is, of its ancient and
festive honors, Christmas is still a period of delightful
excitement in England. It is gratifying
to see that home feeling completely aroused
which seems to hold so powerful a place in every
English bosom. The preparations making on
every side for the social board that is again to
unite friends and kindred; the presents of good
cheer passing and repassing, those tokens of regard
and quickeners of kind feelings; the evergreens
distributed about houses and churches,
emblems of peace and gladness,&mdash;all these
have the most pleasing effect in producing fond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
associations, and kindling benevolent sympathies.
Even the sound of the waits, rude as may be
their minstrelsy, breaks upon the mid-watches of
a winter night with the effect of perfect harmony.
As I have been awakened by them in
that still and solemn hour, "when deep sleep falleth
upon man," I have listened with a hushed
delight, and, connecting them with the sacred
and joyous occasion, have almost fancied them
into another celestial choir, announcing peace
and good-will to mankind.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Amidst the general call to happiness, the bustle
of the spirits, and stir of the affections, which
prevail at this period, what bosom can remain
insensible? It is, indeed, the season of regenerated
feeling,&mdash;the season for kindling, not
merely the fire of hospitality in the hall, but the
genial flame of charity in the heart.</p>

<p>The scene of early love again rises green to
memory beyond the sterile waste of years; and
the idea of home, fraught with the fragrance of
home-dwelling joys, re-animates the drooping
spirit,&mdash;as the Arabian breeze will sometimes
waft the freshness of the distant fields to the
weary pilgrim of the desert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He who can turn churlishly away from contemplating
the felicity of his fellow-beings, and
sit down darkling and repining in his loneliness
when all around is joyful, may have his moments
of strong excitement and selfish gratification, but
he wants the genial and social sympathies which
constitute the charm of a merry Christmas.</p>

<h2>THE OLD OAK-TREE'S LAST DREAM.</h2>


<p>The Oak-tree stood stripped of all his foliage,
ready to go to rest for the whole winter,
and in it to dream many dreams,&mdash;to dream of
the past, just as men dream.</p>

<p>The tree had once been a little one, and had
had a field for its cradle. Now, according to
human reckoning, he was in his fourth century.
He was the tallest and mightiest tree in the
woods; his crown towered high above all the
other trees, and was seen far out on the sea,
serving as a beacon to ships; but the old Oak-tree
had never thought how many eyes sought
him out from afar.</p>

<p>High up in his green crown wood-doves had
built their nests, and the cuckoo perched to announce
spring; and in the autumn, when his
leaves looked like copper-plates hammered out
thin, birds of passage came and rested awhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
among the boughs, before they flew across the
seas. But now it was winter; the tree stood
leafless, and the bowed and crooked branches
displayed their dark outlines; crows and jackdaws
came alternately, gossiping together about
the hard times that were beginning, and the
difficulty of getting food during the winter.</p>

<p>It was just at the holy Christmas-tide that the
Oak-tree dreamt his most beautiful dream: this
dream we will hear.</p>

<p>The tree had a foreboding that a festive season
was nigh; he seemed to hear the church-bells
ringing all round, and to feel as though it were a
mild, warm summer day. Fresh and green, he
reared his mighty crown on high; the sunbeams
played among his leaves and boughs; the air was
filled with fragrance; bright-colored butterflies
gambolled, and gnats danced,&mdash;which was all
they could do to show their joy. And all that
the tree had beheld during his life passed by as
in a festive procession. Knights and ladies, with
feathers in their caps, and hawks perching on
their wrists, rode gayly through the wood; dogs
barked, and the huntsman sounded his bugle.
Then came foreign soldiers in bright armor and
gay vestments, bearing spears and halberds, setting
up their tents, and presently taking them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
down again; then watch-fires blazed up, and
bands of wild outlaws sang, revelled, and slept
under the tree's outstretched boughs, or happy
lovers met in the quiet moonlight, and carved
their initials on the grayish bark. At one time
a guitar, at another an &AElig;olian harp, had been
hung up amid the old oak's boughs, by merry
travelling apprentices; now they hung there
again, and the wind played so sweetly with the
strings. The wood-doves cooed, as though they
would do their best to express the tree's happy
feelings, and the cuckoo talked about himself as
usual, proclaiming how many summer days he
had to live.</p>

<p>And now it seemed a new and stronger current
of life flowed through him, down to his lowest
roots, up to his highest twigs, even to the very
leaves! The tree felt in his roots that a warm life
stirred in the earth,&mdash;felt his strength increase, and
that he was growing taller and taller. His trunk
shot up more and more; his crown grew fuller;
he spread, he towered; and still, as the tree grew,
he felt that his power grew with it, and that his
ardent longing to advance higher and higher up
to the bright warm sun increased also.</p>

<p>Already had he towered above the clouds,
which drifted below him, now like a troop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
dark-plumaged birds of passage, now like flocks
of large white swans.</p>

<p>And every leaf could see, as though it had
eyes; the stars became visible by daylight, so
large and bright, each one sparkling like a mild,
clear eye: they reminded him of dear kind eyes
that had sought each other under his shade,&mdash;lovers'
eyes, children's eyes.</p>

<p>It was a blessed moment; and yet, in the
height of his joy, the Oak-tree felt a desire and
longing that all the other trees, bushes, herbs,
and flowers of the wood might be lifted up with
him, might share in this glory and gladness.
The mighty Oak-tree, amid his dream of splendor,
could not be fully blessed unless he might
have all, little and great, to share it with him;
and this feeling thrilled through boughs and
leaves as strongly, as fervently as though his
were the heart of a man.</p>

<p>The tree's crown bowed itself, as though it
missed and sought something, looked backward.
Then he felt the fragrance of honeysuckles and
violets, and fancied he could hear the cuckoo
answering himself.</p>

<p>Yes, so it was! for now peeped forth, through
the clouds, the green summits of the wood; the
other trees below had grown and lifted themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
up likewise; bushes and herbs shot high into the
air, some tearing themselves loose from their
roots, and mounting all the faster. The birch
had grown most rapidly; like a flash of white
lightning, its slender stem shot upward, its
boughs waving like pale-green banners. Even
the feathery brown reed had pierced its way
through the clouds; and the birds followed, and
sang and sang; and on the grass that fluttered
to and fro like a long streaming green ribbon
perched the grasshopper, and drummed with
his wings on his lean body; the cockchafers
hummed, and the bees buzzed; every bird
sang with all his might, and all was music and
gladness.</p>

<p>"But the little blue flower near the water,&mdash;I
want that too," said the Oak-tree; "and the
bell-flower, and the dear little daisy!" The tree
wanted all these.</p>

<p>"We are here! we are here!" chanted sweet
low voices on all sides.</p>

<p>"But the pretty anemones of last spring, and
the bed of lilies-of-the-valley that blossomed the
year before that! and the wild crab-apple tree!
and all the beautiful trees and flowers that have
adorned the wood through so many seasons&mdash;oh,
would that they had lived till now!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are here! we are here!" was the answer;
and this time it seemed to come from the
air above, as though they had fled upward first.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is too great happiness,&mdash;it is almost
incredible!" exclaimed the Oak-tree. "I
have them all, small and great; not one of them
is forgotten! How can such blessedness be
possible?"</p>

<p>"In the kingdom of God all things are possible,"
was the answer.</p>

<p>And the tree now felt that his roots were loosening
themselves from the earth. "This is best
of all," he said; "now no bonds shall detain me,
I can soar up to the height of light and glory;
and my dear ones are with me, small and great,&mdash;I
have them all!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such was the old Oak-tree's dream; and all
the while, on that holy Christmas Eve, a mighty
storm swept over sea and land: the ocean rolled
its heavy billows on the shore; the tree cracked,
was rent and torn up by the roots, at the very
moment when he dreamt that his roots were disengaging
themselves from the earth. He fell.
His three hundred and sixty-five years were now
as a day is to the May-fly.</p>

<p>On Christmas morning, when the sun burst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
forth, the storm was laid. All the church-bells
were ringing joyously; and from every chimney,
even the poorest, the blue smoke curled upward,
as from the Druids' altar of old uprose the sacrificial
steam. The sea was calm again; and a large
vessel that had weathered the storm the night
before, now hoisted all its flags, in token of Yule
festivity. "The tree is gone,&mdash;the old Oak-tree,
our beacon," said the crew; "it has fallen
during last night's storm. How can its place
ever be supplied?"</p>

<p>This was the tree's funeral eulogium, brief but
well-meant. There he lay, outstretched upon
the snowy carpet near the shore; whilst over it re-echoed
the hymn sung on shipboard,&mdash;the hymn
sung in thanksgiving for the joy of Christmas, for
the bliss of the human soul's salvation, through
Christ, and the gift of eternal life:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sing loud, and raise your voices high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For your redemption draweth nigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lift up your heads, and have no fear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The promised kingdom, it is here!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, take the gift, in joy receive;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All things are his who will believe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O little flock, what words can tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bliss of souls Christ loved so well?<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus resounded the old hymn; and every soul
lifted up heart and desire heavenward, even as
the old tree had lifted himself on his last, best
dream,&mdash;his Christmas Eve dream.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You may think he was sorely puzzled<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What in the world to do;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he went to the Burgomaster,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As the wisest man he knew.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And when they opened the letter,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They stood almost dismayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That such a little child should dare<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To ask the Lord for aid.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the Burgomaster stammered,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And scarce knew what to speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hastily he brushed aside<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A drop, like a tear, from his cheek.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then up he spoke right gruffly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And turned himself about:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"This must be a very foolish boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a small one, too, no doubt."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But when six rosy children<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That night about him pressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor, trusting little Gottlieb<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stood near him, with the rest.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And he heard his simple, touching prayer<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And hastened to his mother;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But he scarce might speak for fear,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The Burgomaster near.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He wasn't afraid of the Holy Babe,<br /></span>

<h2>TINY TIM'S CHRISTMAS DINNER.</h2>


<p>Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife,
dressed out but poorly in a twice turned
gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap and
make a goodly show for sixpence; and she laid
the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of
her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master
Peter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan
of potatoes, and getting the corners of his
monstrous shirt-collar (Bob's private property,
conferred upon his son and heir in honor of the
day) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so
gallantly attired, and yearned to show his linen
in the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller
Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming
that outside the baker's they had smelt
the goose, and known it for their own; and
basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onion,
these young Cratchits danced about the table,
and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
while he (not proud, although his collars nearly
choked him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes,
bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan
lid to be let out and peeled.</p>

<p>"What has ever got your precious father
then?" said Mrs. Cratchit. "And your brother
Tiny Tim! And Martha warn't as late last
Christmas Day by half an hour!"</p>

<p>"Here's Martha, mother!" said a girl, appearing
as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Here's Martha, mother!" cried the two
young Cratchits. "Hurrah! There's <i>such</i> a
goose, Martha!"</p>

<p>"Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how
late you are!" said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a
dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet
for her with officious zeal.</p>

<p>"We'd a deal of work to finish up last night,"
replied the girl, "and had to clear away this
morning, mother!"</p>

<p>"Well! never mind so long as you are come,"
said Mrs. Cratchit. "Sit ye down before the fire,
my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!"</p>

<p>"No, no! there's father coming," cried the
two young Cratchits, who were everywhere at
once. "Hide, Martha, hide!"</p>

<p>So Martha hid herself; and in came little Bob,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the father, with at least three feet of comforter
exclusive of the fringe hanging down before
him, and his threadbare clothes darned up and
brushed to look seasonable, and Tiny Tim upon
his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little
crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron
frame!</p>

<p>"Why, where's our Martha?" cried Bob
Cratchit, looking round.</p>

<p>"Not coming," said Mrs. Cratchit.</p>

<p>"Not coming!" said Bob, with a sudden declension
in his high spirits; for he had been
Tim's blood horse all the way from church, and
had come home rampant. "Not coming upon
Christmas Day!"</p>

<p>Martha didn't like to see him disappointed,
if it were only a joke; so she came out prematurely
from behind the closet door, and ran into
his arms, while the two young Cratchits hustled
Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash-house,
that he might hear the pudding singing in the
copper.</p>

<p>"And how did little Tim behave?" asked
Mrs. Cratchit, when she had rallied Bob on his
credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to
his heart's content.</p>

<p>"As good as gold," said Bob, "and better.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Somehow he gets thoughtful, sitting by himself
so much, and thinks the strangest things you
ever heard. He told me, coming home, that he
hoped the people saw him in the church, because
he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant
to them to remember upon Christmas Day who
made lame beggars walk and blind men see."</p>

<p>Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them
this, and trembled more when he said that Tiny
Tim was growing strong and hearty.</p>

<p>His active little crutch was heard upon the
floor, and back came Tiny Tim before another
word was spoken, escorted by his brother and
sister to his stool beside the fire; and while Bob,
turning up his cuffs,&mdash;as if, poor fellow, they
were capable of being made more shabby,&mdash;compounded
some hot mixture in a jug with gin
and lemons, and stirred it round and round and
put it on the hob to simmer, Master Peter and
the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch
the goose, with which they soon returned in high
procession.</p>

<p>Such a bustle ensued that you might have
thought a goose the rarest of all birds,&mdash;a feathered
phenomenon, to which a black swan was a
matter of course; and in truth it was something
very like it in that house. Mrs. Cratchit made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan)
hissing hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes
with incredible vigor; Miss Belinda sweetened
up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted the hot
plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny
corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set
chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves,
and mounting guard upon their posts, crammed
spoons into their mouths, lest they should shriek
for goose before their turn came to be helped.
At last the dishes were set on, and grace was
said. It was succeeded by a breathless pause,
as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the
carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast;
but when she did, and when the long-expected
gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of delight
arose all round the board, and even Tiny
Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits, beat
on the table with the handle of his knife, and
feebly cried Hurrah!</p>

<p>There never was such a goose. Bob said he
didn't believe there ever was such a goose
cooked. Its tenderness and flavor, size and
cheapness, were the themes of universal admiration.
Eked out by apple-sauce and mashed
potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole
family; indeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
delight (surveying one small atom of a bone
upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last!
Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest
Cratchits in particular were steeped in sage
and onion to the eyebrows! But now the plates
being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left
the room alone&mdash;too nervous to bear witnesses&mdash;to
take the pudding up, and bring it in.</p>

<p>Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose
it should break in turning out! Suppose
somebody should have got over the wall of the
back yard, and stolen it, while they were merry
with the goose,&mdash;a supposition at which the
two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of
horrors were supposed.</p>

<p>Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding
was out of the copper. A smell like a washing-day!
That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house
and a pastry-cook's next door to each
other, with a laundress's next door to that!
That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs.
Cratchit entered&mdash;flushed, but smiling proudly&mdash;with
the pudding, like a speckled cannon-ball,
so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern
of ignited brandy, and bedight with
Christmas holly stuck into the top.</p>

<p>Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and calmly too, that he regarded it as the greatest
success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since their
marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that now the weight
was off her mind, she would confess she had her
doubts about the quantity of flour. Everybody
had something to say about it, but nobody said
or thought it was at all a small pudding for a
large family. It would have been flat heresy to
do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint
at such a thing.</p>

<p>At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was
cleared, the hearth swept, and the fire made up.
The compound in the jug being tasted, and considered
perfect, apples and oranges were put
upon the table, and a shovelful of chestnuts on
the fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew
round the hearth, in what Bob Cratchit called a
circle, meaning half a one; and at Bob Cratchit's
elbow stood the family display of glass,&mdash;two
tumblers and a custard-cup without a handle.</p>

<p>These held the hot stuff from the jug, however,
as well as golden goblets would have done;
and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while
the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked
noisily. Then Bob proposed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God
bless us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Which all the family re-echoed.</p>

<p>"God bless us every one!" said Tiny Tim,
the last of all.</p>

<p>He sat very close to his father's side, upon his
little stool. Bob held his withered little hand in
his, as if he loved the child, and wished to keep
him by his side, and dreaded that he might be
taken from him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Scrooge!" said Bob; "I'll give you,
Mr. Scrooge, the Founder of the Feast!"</p>

<p>"The Founder of the Feast indeed!" cried
Mrs. Cratchit, reddening. "I wished I had him
here. I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast
upon, and I hope he'd have a good appetite
for it."</p>

<p>"My dear," said Bob, "the children! Christmas
Day!"</p>

<p>"It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,"
said she, "on which one drinks the health of
such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as
Mr. Scrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody
knows it better than you do, poor fellow!"</p>

<p>"My dear," was Bob's mild answer, "Christmas
Day!"</p>

<p>"I'll drink his health for your sake and the
Day's," said Mrs. Cratchit, "not for his. Long
life to him! A merry Christmas and a happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
new year! He'll be very merry and very happy,
I have no doubt!"</p>

<p>The children drank the toast after her. It
was the first of their proceedings which had no
heartiness in it! Tiny Tim drank it last of all,
but he didn't care twopence for it. Scrooge was
the Ogre of the family. The mention of his
name cast a dark shadow on the party, which
was not dispelled for full five minutes.</p>

<p>After it had passed away, they were ten times
merrier than before, from the mere relief of
Scrooge the Baleful being done with. Bob
Cratchit told them how he had a situation in
his eye for Master Peter, which would bring in,
if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The
two young Cratchits laughed tremendously at the
idea of Peter's being a man of business; and
Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from
between his collars, as if he were deliberating
what particular investments he should favor when
he came into the receipt of that bewildering income.
Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a
milliner's, then told them what kind of work she
had to do, and how many hours she worked at
a stretch, and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow
morning for a good long rest; to-morrow
being a holiday she passed at home. Also how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
she had seen a countess and a lord some days
before, and how the lord "was much about as
tall as Peter," at which Peter pulled up his collars
so high that you couldn't have seen his
head if you had been there. All this time the
chestnuts and the jug went round and round;
and by and by they had a song, about a lost
child travelling in the snow, from Tiny Tim, who
had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well
indeed.</p>

<h2>CHRISTMAS DAY IN LONDON.</h2>


<p>The poulterers' shops were still half open, and
the fruiterers' shops were radiant in their
glory. There were great round, pot-bellied baskets
of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of jolly
old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling
out into the street in their apoplectic opulence.
There were ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed
Spanish onions, shining in the fatness of their
growth like Spanish Friars, and winking from
their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as
they went by and glanced demurely at the
hung up mistletoe. There were pears and apples,
clustered high in blooming pyramids; there
were bunches of grapes, made, in the shop-keepers'
benevolence, to dangle from conspicuous
hooks that people's mouths might water
gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts,
mossy and brown, recalling, in their fragrance,
ancient walks among the woods, and pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
shufflings ankle-deep through withered leaves;
there were Norfolk Biffins, squab and swarthy,
setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons,
and, in the great compactness of their juicy persons,
urgently entreating and beseeching to be
carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner.
The very gold and silver fish, set forth
among these choice fruits in a bowl, though
members of a dull and stagnant-blooded race,
appeared to know that there was something going
on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and
round their little world in slow and passionless
excitement.</p>

<p>The Grocers'! oh, the Grocers'! nearly closed,
with perhaps two shutters down, or one; but
through those gaps such glimpses! It was not
alone that the scales descending on the counter
made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller
parted company so briskly, or that the canisters
were rattled up and down like juggling tricks, or
even that the blended scents of tea and coffee
were so grateful to the nose, or even that the
raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so
extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long
and straight, the other spices so delicious, the
candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten
sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on feel faint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that the
figs were moist and pulpy, or that the French
plums blushed in modest tartness from their
highly decorated boxes, or that everything was
good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but the
customers were all so hurried and so eager in the
hopeful promise of the day, that they tumbled
up against each other at the door, crashing their
wicker baskets wildly, and left their purchases
upon the counter, and came running back to
fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like
mistakes, in the best humor possible; while the
Grocer and his people were so frank and fresh
that the polished hearts with which they fastened
their aprons behind might have been their own,
worn outside for general inspection, and for
Christmas daws to peck at if they chose.</p>

<span class="caption">IN THE CHURCH.</span>
</div>

<p>But soon the steeples called good people all
to church and chapel; and away they came,
flocking through the streets in their best clothes
and with their gayest faces. And at the same
time there emerged from scores of by-streets,
lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable people,
carrying their dinners to the bakers' shops.
The sight of these poor revellers appeared to
interest the Spirit very much; for he stood with
Scrooge beside him in a baker's doorway, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
taking off the covers as their bearers passed,
sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch.
And it was a very uncommon kind of torch; for
once or twice when there were angry words between
some dinner-carriers who had jostled each
other, he shed a few drops of water on them
from it, and their good humor was restored directly.
For they said, it was a shame to quarrel
upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love
it, so it was!</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE MATCH-GIRL.</h2>


<p>It was terribly cold; it snowed and was already
almost dark, and evening came on,&mdash;the
last evening of the year. In the cold and
gloom a poor little girl, bareheaded and barefoot,
was walking through the streets. When
she left her own house she certainly had had
slippers on; but of what use were they? They
were very big slippers, and her mother had used
them till then, so big were they. The little maid
lost them as she slipped across the road, where
two carriages were rattling by terribly fast. One
slipper was not to be found again; and a boy had
seized the other, and run away with it. He
thought he could use it very well as a cradle,
some day when he had children of his own. So
now the little girl went with her little naked feet,
which were quite red and blue with the cold. In
an old apron she carried a number of matches
and a bundle of them in her hand. No one had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
bought anything of her all day, and no one had
given her a farthing.</p>

<p>Shivering with cold and hunger, she crept
along, a picture of misery, poor little girl! The
snowflakes covered her long fair hair, which
fell in pretty curls over her neck; but she did
not think of that now. In all the windows lights
were shining, and there was a glorious smell of
roast goose, for it was New Year's Eve. Yes,
she thought of that!</p>

<p>In a corner formed by two houses, one of
which projected beyond the other, she sat down,
cowering. She had drawn up her little feet, but she
was still colder, and she did not dare to go home,
for she had sold no matches, and did not bring a
farthing of money. From her father she would
certainly receive a beating; and, besides, it was
cold at home, for they had nothing over them but
a roof through which the wind whistled, though
the largest rents had been stopped with straw
and rags.</p>

<p>Her little hands were almost benumbed with
the cold. Ah! a match might do her good, if
she could only draw one from the bundle, and
rub it against the wall, and warm her hands at it.
She drew one out. R-r-atch! how it sputtered
and burned! It was a warm bright flame, like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
little candle, when she held her hands over it; it
was a wonderful little light! It really seemed to
the little girl as if she sat before a great polished
stove, with bright brass feet and a brass cover.
How the fire burned! how comfortable it was!
but the little flame went out, the stove vanished,
and she had only the remains of the burned
match in her hand.</p>

<p>A second was rubbed against the wall. It
burned up; and when the light fell upon the wall
it became transparent like a thin veil, and she
could see through it into the room. On the
table a snow-white cloth was spread; upon it
stood a shining dinner service; the roast goose
smoked gloriously, stuffed with apples and dried
plums. And what was still more splendid to behold,
the goose hopped down from the dish, and
waddled along the floor, with a knife and fork in
its breast, to the little girl. Then the match
went out, and only the thick, damp, cold wall
was before her. She lighted another match.
Then she was sitting under a beautiful Christmas
tree; it was greater and more ornamented than
the one she had seen through the glass door
at the rich merchant's. Thousands of candles
burned upon the green branches, and colored
pictures like those in the print shops looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
down upon them. The little girl stretched forth
her hand toward them; then the match went
out. The Christmas lights mounted higher.
She saw them now as stars in the sky: one of
them fell down, forming a long line of fire.</p>

<p>"Now some one is dying," thought the little
girl; for her old grandmother, the only person
who had loved her, and who was now dead, had
told her that when a star fell down a soul
mounted up to God.</p>

<p>She rubbed another match against the wall; it
became bright again, and in the brightness the
old grandmother stood clear and shining, mild
and lovely.</p>

<p>"Grandmother!" cried the child, "oh, take
me with you! I know you will go when the
match is burned out. You will vanish like the
warm fire, the warm food, and the great, glorious
Christmas tree!"</p>

<p>And she hastily rubbed the whole bundle of
matches, for she wished to hold her grandmother
fast. And the matches burned with such a glow
that it became brighter than in the middle of the
day; grandmother had never been so large or so
beautiful. She took the little girl in her arms,
and both flew in brightness and joy above the
earth, very, very high; and up there was neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
cold nor hunger nor care,&mdash;they were with
God.</p>

<p>But in the corner, leaning against the wall, sat
the poor girl with red cheeks and smiling mouth,
frozen to death on the last evening of the Old
Year. The New Year's sun rose upon a little
corpse! The child sat there, stiff and cold, with
the matches, of which one bundle was burned.
"She wanted to warm herself," the people said.
No one imagined what a beautiful thing she had
seen, and in what glory she had gone in with her
grandmother to the New Year's Day.</p>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
